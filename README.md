# The Live Status of Novel Coronavirus in Australia

> “Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all.”

This site is to show the latest status of COVID-19 in Australia, and you can check it in [https://covid-19-au.github.io](https://covid-19-au.github.io).
This site accumulates the information from different resources including:
* The overall affected cases in each state;
* The trend of affected cases;
* Some tweets and news about COVID-19;
* The map location of patitent's trace, and hospitals which can carry out COVID-19 tests (incoming);


We keep updating it from time to time.
All the data comes from official resources such as the [Government](https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/), [News Group](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/) and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
